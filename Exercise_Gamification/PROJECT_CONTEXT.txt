Project 1 from ESC180: Exercise Gamification
Professor: Michael Guerzhoy

This project simulates a gamified exercise tracking app that encourages users to engage in physical activities by 
awarding "stars" and tracking health points and hedons (fun points). The user can perform three activities—running, 
carrying textbooks, or resting—each of which contributes differently to their health and enjoyment. 

Running grants 3 health points per minute for up to 180 minutes and 1 health point per minute thereafter.
Carrying textbooks always provides 2 health points per minute. 
Resting does not contribute to health but allows the user to recover from fatigue. 

The system models hedonic rewards based on whether the user is tired or not:

Running grants 2 hedons per minute for the first 10 minutes (if the user is not tired) and -2 hedons per minute afterward
Carrying textbooks provides 1 hedon per minute for the first 20 minutes and -1 hedon per minute after that. 
If a star is offered for an activity, and the user engages in it immediately, they receive an additional 3 hedons per minute for up to 10 minutes. 
However, offering too many stars in a short period (three within two hours) causes the user to lose interest, preventing further hedon rewards from stars. 

The simulation consists of a sequence of operations where activities are performed, stars are offered, 
and the system is queried for the user’s current health points, hedons, and the most rewarding activity for a given moment.
