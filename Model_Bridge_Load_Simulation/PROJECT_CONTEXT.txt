Project from CIV102: Model Bridge Failure Load Simulation
Professor: Evan Bentz

This code was written for the final bridge project in CIV102, where my team had to build a bridge out of 
MatBoard and predict how much loading it can support before failure. To do this, I wrote this code, which 
takes in the cross section of the bridge and its length and then returns the under what kind of failure the 
bridge will fail.

Our bridge had three different cross-sections: one for where the Bending Moment was the highest, one for 
where the Shear Force was the highest, and the main design for the areas in between. 
The Bridge_FinalDesignPlots.mlx code takes in the parameters given in the other code for each cross-section, 
and plots the shear force and bending moment diagram across out final bridge design. It also returns what kind of 
failure the bridge will succumb to and at what loading.

Our estimation using this code was 800N of maximum loading which was 85% accurate to the real load our bridge failed at 
after testing, which was 650N.
